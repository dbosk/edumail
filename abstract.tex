% What's the problem?
We receive emails from students asking why they haven't gotten their grades 
reported yet.
% Why is it a problem? Research gap left by other approaches?
Since all grades are reported automatically, this means that there is something 
they haven't done.
% Why is it important? Why care?
We still have to answer these emails, which is a waste of time.
So we need to reduce the time it takes to answer.

% What's the approach? How to solve the problem?
Our approach is to write utilities that parse the email and generate the needed 
commands to find the students results.
We need to look these up to answer the question and it's good to send these to 
the student so that they see.
% What's the findings? How was it evaluated, what are the results, limitations, 
% what remains to be done?
